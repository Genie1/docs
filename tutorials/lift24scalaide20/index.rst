Setup and use Lift framework 2.4 in Scala IDE 2.0
=================================================

What is in this guide?
----------------------

This guide will show you how to configure a Lift web application to import it in Scala IDE, how to configure `Scala IDE`_ to work with the Lift framework and finally how to develop a Lift web application from inside Scala IDE.

Prerequisites
.............

*   `Eclipse`_ 3.7.1 (Indigo) with Scala IDE for Scala 2.9 installed (update site: http://download.scala-ide.org/releases-29/stable/site).

    Check the :ref:`getting started <gettingstarted_getting-started>` page for instructions on how to install Scala IDE.
    
*   `sbt`_ 0.11 installed.

    Check the `sbt Getting Started Guide`_ for instructions on how to install sbt.

*   Basic knowledge of the Eclipse user interface is required.

*   Basic knowledge of the Scala language is required (in this guide).

*   Basic knowledge of the Simple Build Tool (sbt) is required (in this guide).

*   Basic knowledge of the Lift framework is required (in this guide).

Setting up a Lift project
-------------------------

Start by creating a basic Lift project

*	Download the Lift 2.4 release from http://liftweb.net/download

*	Unzip it and copy the folder "scala_29/lift_basic" to your preferred location. Letâ€™s say "/path/to/lift_basic" for the purpose of this document.

*	Go to "/path/to/lift_basic" and delete the "project" folder as well as the files "sbt-launcher.jar", "sbt" and "sbt.bat"

*	Create a file "build.sbt" with the following contents: <insert screenshot here>

*	In a console go to "/path/to/lift_basic" and run "sbt".

*	Once sbt has successfully started run the "update" task to download all needed dependencies.

Configuring the Lift project for Scala IDE
------------------------------------------

To be able to import the project into Eclipse we are going to use the `sbteclipse`_ plugin for sbt to generate the Eclipse project files (.project, .classpath and optionally files in the .settings/ folder).

*	In your home folder create the folder structure ".sbt/plugins". In it create a file "build.sbt" with the following contents: <insert screenshot here> . For sbt version 0.11.2 (and higher) use the following: <insert screenshot here> . This will make the sbteclipse plugin globally available in all your sbt projects. See the `sbteclipse wiki`_ for more information on how to install sbteclipse as a global or local plugin

*	In a console go to "/path/to/lift_basic" and run "sbt".

*	Once sbt has started run the "eclipse with-sources" task to generate the Eclipse project files.

Importing the Lift project into Scala IDE
-----------------------------------------

Everything is setup, it is time to import the project into the IDE.

*	Import the Lift project as an "Existing Project" into your Workspace (File --> Import --> Existing Projects into Workspace)

Running and Debugging the Lift project in Scala IDE
---------------------------------------------------

The lift_basic project includes the RunWebApp Application in "src/test/scala" which bootstraps the embedded Jetty server.

*	Right click "RunWebApp.scala" in Eclipse and select "Run As --> Scala Application" (or "Debug As --> Scala Application").

*	Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080 to see your running Lift application.

Optional: enabling JRebel support for the Lift project in Scala IDE
-------------------------------------------------------------------

*	TODO

Going further
-------------

You now have all you need to create great web applications with Lift 2.4 and Scala.
