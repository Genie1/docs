Implicit Hyperlinking
=====================

.. note::

	`Implicit Highlighting`__ needs to be enabled.

With *Implicit Hyperlinking* you can hyperlink to an implicit definition. 

Hold down |keystroke| and hover over a binding. If an implicit conversion 
has been applied to the hovered binding, a contextual menu will open, giving you a chance 
to navigate to either the binding's declaration (a.k.a. 
`definition hyperlinking`__) or to the implicit definition!



.. image:: images/implicit-hyperlink.png

.. role:: raw-html(raw)
   :format: html

.. |keystroke| replace:: :raw-html:`<span class="keystroke">Ctrl/Cmd</span>`
