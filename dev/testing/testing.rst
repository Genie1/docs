Testing the Scala IDE
=====================

The Scala IDE relies for most of its functionality on two pillars:

.. toctree::
  :maxdepth: 1

  presentation-compiler-tests
  eclipse-tests

Testing should therefore be directed to the two of them, but also to their integration. 

.. note:: The presentation compiler test suite is part of the Scala source tree.
